Check Speech
============
This should be common rules for writing scientific papers, but when english 
is not your mother tongue or native language, some phrases can just hop 
through. Also when you are tired you tend to write sloppy.

This script checks your wording and speech and shows you some hints what 
might be wrong. Not every hit is really bad. There could be a lot of false
positives and vice versa.

The results are better, if you do not break your text lines in your document
by yourself, but rather use something like smart or soft linebreaks. Also try 
to apply it on pure text, not marked up (LaTeX).
